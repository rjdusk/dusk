This website has been a long time coming, to be honest. It has been a pet project now for a good 3 years. First with getting a grips on preprocessing and everything that entails. Then GIT, though that should have really come first. Followed by settling on a CMS that fit my workflow and not defaulting to Wordpress. I settled for <a href="https://craftcms.com/" target="_blank">Craft</a> if you're interested, the depth of customisation on the front and back end is amazing, plus writing templates in twig is a dream.

Ever since I quit my corporate job at HP, I've been playing catch up, I had let myself get lazy and complacent. HP had a prescribed way of doing things. Plug content into Dreamweaver templates, upload, then have a 3 hour long conference call to discuss. You stop challenging yourself to push forward and try new things, you fall into a rut.

Then life happened. Moving countries, attempting to learn languages, having children, travel and having a day job of managing all the creative material at a biotech company-and all its child companies-left me with very little time for much else.

So here I am, still in Norway and not sure where our next move will take us. Regardless though my work can be done from anywhere, so professionally it is of little consequence.

I continue fiddling around in the background with this site. My next side project is to build a Northern Lights app, either using React Native or something similar. I don't feel like restricting my work to walled gardens (iOS or Android), so either a web based app or something built in React Native should suffice.

At 34, I still find learning new Front-end development techniques fun and challenging, I guess that's called a good career choice?
