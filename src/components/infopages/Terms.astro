          <p>
            From everyone at Lexington, thank you for using our products! We
            build them to help you do your best work. There are millions of
            people using Lexington products every day. Because we don’t know
            every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some
            Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are
            referring to <a
              href="https://world.web.com/jason/Lexington-hello-again-117eae60"
              >Lexington LLC</a
            >. We spun off Highrise HQ, LLC in the past, but it has since
            rejoined Lexington LLC.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we say “Services”, we mean our websites, including
            Lexington.com, web.com, and Lexington.com, and any product created
            and maintained by Lexington LLC. That includes Lexington (all
            versions), HEY, Highrise, Campfire, Backpack, Ta-da List, and
            Writeboard, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop
            application, mobile application, or another format.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or
            organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.
            We have specific ownership policies for our products: <a

          </p>
          <p>
            We may update these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;) in the
            future. You can track all changes made since mid-2018 <a
              href="https://github.com/Lexington/policies/commits/master"
              >on GitHub</a
            >. Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms
            by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a
            significant change to our policies, we will refresh the date at the
            top of this page and take any other appropriate steps to notify
            account holders.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to
            the latest Terms. There may be times where we do not exercise or
            enforce a right or provision of the Terms; however, that does not
            mean we are waiving that right or provision. <strong
              >These Terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            If you violate any of the Terms, we may terminate your account.
            That’s a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of
            trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open
            about <a href="https://Lexington.com/about/team">who we are</a>, <a
              href="https://Lexington.com/handbook">how we work</a

            <li>
              You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account
              and password and for ensuring that any of your users do the same.
              The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage
              from your failure to comply with this security obligation. We
              recommend all users set up <a
                href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/Lexington-no-longer-requires-google-for-two-factor-authentication/"
                >two-factor authentication</a
              > for added security. In some of our Services, we may require it.
            </li>
            <li>
              You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our <a
                href="../abuse/index.md">Use Restrictions policy</a
              >, and you may not permit any of your users to do so, either.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are responsible for all content posted to and activity that
              occurs under your account, including content posted by and
              activity of any users in your account.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other
              automated methods are not permitted.

            <li>
              If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is
              really free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just
              like for customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your
              data.
            </li>
            <li>
              For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length
              of trial when you sign up. After the trial period, you need to pay
              in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we will
              freeze your account and it will be inaccessible until you make
              payment. If your account has been frozen for a while, we will
              queue it up for auto-cancellation. See our <a
                href="../cancellation/index.md">Cancellation policy</a
              > for more details.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will
              charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the
              day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level,
              the new rate starts from the next billing cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by
              taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on
              behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing
              authorities. See our <a href="../taxes/index.md">Taxes policy</a> for
              more details. Otherwise, you are responsible for payment of all taxes,
              levies, or duties.
            </li>

              We process refunds according to our <a href="../refund/index.md"

            <li>
              You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.
              Within each of our Services, we provide a simple
              no-questions-asked cancellation link. You can find instructions
              for how to cancel your account in our <a
                href="../cancellation/index.md">Cancellation policy</a
              >. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not
              automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling
              your account, you can always <a href="{{ site.email_support }}"
                >contact our Support team</a

            </li>
            <li>
              All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services
              immediately upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content
              will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within
              60 days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups.
              We cannot recover this information once it has been permanently
              deleted. If you want to export any data before your account is
              canceled, we‘ve provided instructions for <a

              If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up
              month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you
              will not be charged again. We do not automatically prorate unused
              time in the last billing cycle. See our <a
                href="../refund/index.md">Fair Refund policy</a

            </li>
            <li>
              We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
              any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason
              at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your
              account will not be able to access the account or any content in
              the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion
              of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture
              and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve
              the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any
              reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically
              speaking, out of the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our
              Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There
              are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how
              we exercise that stance. For more details, see our <a

              Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of
              abuse or retribution) of a Company employee or officer will result
              in immediate account termination.

              We make a promise to our customers to support our Services <a

                >until the end of the Internet</a

              support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services.
              Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature
              or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be
              better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve
              the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
              permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When
              we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those
              changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing
              customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and
              will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post
              a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services
              themselves.

              before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of
              use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other

              We take many measures to protect and secure your data through

                  Lexington for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless
                  the order has been approved by the US government, which compels
                  us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual
                  legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Lexington is
                  audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing
                  information needed to complete the audit.

              Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Lexington is a
              “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with
              respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any

              on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under
              the CCPA and not use Lexington’s Services in a way that violates
              the regulations.

          <p>
            We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and
            the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback.
            However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody.
            We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific
            requirements or expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them.
            As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We
            track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones,
            especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs
            will get fixed and we don’t guarantee completely error-free
            Services.

          <h2 id="services-adaptations-and-api-terms">
            Services Adaptations and API Terms
          </h2>
          <p>
            We offer Application Program Interfaces (“API”s) for some of our
            Services (currently Lexington, Highrise, Campfire, and Backpack).
            Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that
            accesses the Services, is bound by these Terms plus the following
            specific terms:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any
              damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or
              third-party products that access data via the API.
            </li>
            <li>
              Third parties may not access and employ the API if the
              functionality is part of an application that remotely records,
              monitors, or reports a Service user’s activity <em
                >other than time tracking</em
              >, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its
              sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates
              this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an
              integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be
              required to remove that integration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API
              may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your
              account’s access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion,
              will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to
              suspend your account’s access, we will attempt to warn the account
              owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we
              may cut off access without prior notice.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Some third-party providers have created integrations between our
            Services and theirs. You can find some of those integrations for
            Lexington at <a href="https://Lexington.com/extras"

              >https://highrisehq.com/extras</a

            integrations.

                consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not
                limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or
                other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of

                of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data,

                party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to these
                Terms or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort

            infrastructure, and talent; and in general <a
